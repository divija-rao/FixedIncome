Interest Rate Modeling: Short Rates to Market Models

Interest rate modeling is a cornerstone of financial mathematics, playing a crucial role in the valuation of fixed income securities and derivatives. This project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of interest rate dynamics and their impact on fixed income product pricing.

We will focus on Treasury bonds as our primary fixed income product due to their status as the benchmark for interest rates, their risk-free nature, and the abundance of available data. This choice allows us to concentrate on the intricacies of interest rate modeling without the added complexity of credit risk.

The project will progress from simple short-rate models to more sophisticated ones, providing a holistic view of interest rate modeling techniques. We will implement and compare various models, including Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR), and Hull-White, using Monte Carlo simulation methods. This selection of models represents a natural progression in complexity and practical relevance within the short-rate modeling framework.

Objectives:
Develop a thorough understanding of Treasury bonds and their pricing mechanics
Implement and calibrate multiple interest rate models using historical data
Conduct Monte Carlo simulations to generate interest rate paths and price Treasury bonds
Compare the performance and accuracy of different models in various market scenarios
Analyze the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in model parameters and market conditions

We will use Python as our primary programming language for model implementation and simulation, leveraging its robust financial libraries and data analysis tools.

We will explore the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela (BGM) framework as an introduction to market models, bridging the gap between short-rate models and more advanced techniques in interest rate modeling.
